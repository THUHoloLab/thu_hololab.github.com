### Research Interests 
1. Information optics based on holography (i.e. computed generated holographic three-dimensional display, and digital holographic imaging, High-density holographic optical storage, parallel optical computing); 
2. Volume holographic materials and gratings (i.e. photopolymers, nanocomposites; LiNbO3 crystals, multiplexed gratings; mixed gratings); 
3. Applications of technologies in laser beam steering, spectral filter, remote image processing, high-speed image processor, high-resolution display, and education.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/THUHoloLab/thu_hololab.github.com/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown
